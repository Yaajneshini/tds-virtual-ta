This is the final Mock before actual ROE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmock_roe_4.pdf\n\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have a \nspecial\n session scheduled for tonight from 8pm to 10pm. We will be sharing some important information during that session which will help you for your ROE. It is available in your google calendar.\n\n\nThe meet link for that session is:\n\n\nROE Preparation - TDS\n\n\nFriday, February 28 · 8:00 – 10:00pm\n\n\nTime zone: Asia/Kolkata\n\n\nVideo call link: \nhttps://meet.google.com/nnq-sxqh-ryw\n\n\nThe session will be recorded and live streamed on YouTube.\n\nIt will be available on the TDS YouTube Playlist later.\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTDS Team\n\n\nUpdate 4\n\n\n27/02/2025 7:18pm\n\n\nDear Learner,\n\n\nPlease find the link to Mock ROE 3 below. Note the datasets links are present inside the given document (there are more than 1):\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndrive.google.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMOCK ROE 3.pdf\n\n\nGoogle Drive file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimated time for this Mock ROE 3 is 45 mins.\n\n\nAll the best,\n\nTDS Team\n\n\nUpdate 3\n\n\n26/02/2025 8:11 pm\n\n\nDear Learner\n\n\nPlease access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.\n\nAfter the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).\n\nTo check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.\n\n\ninputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')\ntextboxes = document.querySelectorAll(\"textarea\")\nbuttons = document.querySelectorAll(\"button\")\ninputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\nbuttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\ntextboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));\n\n\n\nDo not submit or save your answers.\n\n\nAll the best!\n\nKind regards\n\nTDS Team\n\n\nUpdate 2\n\n\n26/02/2025 11:00 am\n\n\nWe will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).\n\nThe link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.\n\n\nWe will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nTDS Team\n\n\n\n\nUpdate 1\n\n\n25/02/2025 7:46pm\n\n\nWe have now closed the mock submissions.\n\nBoth the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncement\n\n\n25/02/2025\n\n\nThis same information is available in the seek portal as well.\n\n\nThe data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\n\n\nJivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1\n\n\nThe questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:\n\n\nhttps://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6\n\n\nIMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.\n\n\nThe form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.\n\n\nWe have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.\n\n\nWe will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.\n\n\nAll the best!"

      "content": "@23f2003413\n\n\nWe will have it uploaded sometime this morning.\n\n\nIt has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\n\n\n\n\nThe chaos of ROE.\n\n\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\n\n\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\n\n\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\n\n\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\n\n\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\n\n\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\n\n\nHow limited the time is.\n\n\n\n\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\n\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\n\n\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\n\n\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\n\n\nKind regards"
