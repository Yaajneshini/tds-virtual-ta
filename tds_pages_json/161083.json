With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\n\n\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection."
