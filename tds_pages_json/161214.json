      "content": "Dear all,\n\n\nI’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the *Tools in Data Science * course: \nLLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator\n.  This is the basic prototype.\n\n\nThis tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.\n\n\nA heartfelt thanks to \n@s.anand\n, our course instructor, and TAs \n@Carlton\n and \n@Jivraj\n, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.\n\n\nI’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:\n\n\n\n\nExpand functionality and evaluation models.\n\n\nFix bugs and optimize workflows.\n\n\nImprove documentation for broader accessibility.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nGitHub repository\n is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!\n\n\nUpdate: here is a video explaining the process - \nhttps://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared\n\nBest regards,\n\nAvinash Shrivastava"
