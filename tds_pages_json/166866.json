I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project.\n\n\nThanks\n\nVikram"

Here are the highlights of the discussion:\n\n\n\n\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\n\n\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\n\n\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\n\n\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\n\n\n\n\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\n\n\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\n\n\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\n\n\nKind regards\n\nTDS Team"

We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying."

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn’t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team’s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you."
