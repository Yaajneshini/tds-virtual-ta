It was great to meet you Sir, and was a great pleasant surprise to meet our wonderful TAs, \n@carlton\n and \n@jivraj\n (and, TAs for Java and Statistics I too. sorry, I am unable to tag them with names) as well. I am inspired to continue learning deeper and more… such interactions are very helpful. Thank you."
