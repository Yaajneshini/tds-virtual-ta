I saw a similar older thread where it was mentioned that this is not something to worry about but now it is showing in the portal that I am not allowed to take the End Term Exam. What can be done for this?\n\n\nSS\n1895×1010 167 KB"

Which is in the link provided (it is actually in the screen shot you have provided).\n\nAll the previous GA 1 through 4 were also exactly the same.\n\n\nWe have no evidence you ever submitted any of the other GAs except GA1.\n\n\nKind regards"
