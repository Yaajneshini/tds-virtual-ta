From containerization to prompt tuning.\n\nBut I am \npersonally offended\n by one thing‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúHow dare you give \nbonus marks on Week 7\n?\n\nI skipped it ‚Äî just like many ‚Äî because we were told \nonly best 4 of 7 would count\n.\n\nI demand justice. And a belly rub.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì \n, Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Moral of the story:\n\n\nLet your pets help with your coursework.\n\nYou get the grade. They get the rage."
