      "content": "@s.anand\n \n@carlton\n \n@Jivraj\n \n@Saransh_Saini\n\n\nI would like to share that we have successfully completed \nTDS Project 2\n, solving \n46/57\n cases dynamically via \nAzure after deployment\n! We also tested it with our friends’ \nGA questions\n, and it’s working as expected.\n\n\nThis project was a \nteam effort\n by me and two friends [ \n@lakshaygarg654\n and \n@23f2004637\n ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.\n\n\nI would love the opportunity to \ndemonstrate our project\n to \nTA and Anand Sir\n in a \nGoogle Meet session\n on \nMarch 31st\n (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).\n\n\nIf you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response."

However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my \nAzure API URL would be exposed\n, and since it incurs \ncosts per usage\n, I need to keep it secure.\n\n\nI’d prefer a \nprivate meet\n to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!"
