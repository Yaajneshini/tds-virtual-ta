The license file was named properly and contained the correct content.\n\n\nHowever, I received a message stating that the MIT License was not present, and that the prerequisites were not completed — resulting in a failed status. This is surprising and feels unfair, as I’ve double-checked my submission and confirmed that everything, including the license file, is in place and named correctly.\n\n\nHere is my GitHub repo for your reference: \nGitHub - virajpitale/tds-project1\n\n\nI kindly request a re-evaluation of my submission, as I believe I’ve met all the required criteria. I would really appreciate your time in looking into this matter again.\n\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\n\n@Jivraj"
