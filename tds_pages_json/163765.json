Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.\n\n\nThe last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.\n\n\nKind regards"

      "content": "Hello,\n\nI am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?"

You can load from any of these. \n \n[image]\n \nDo remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic. \nPlease check this out and let me know if there are any bugs.
